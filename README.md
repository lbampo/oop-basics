 ### Definitions
####Instance - 
 A specific example of a class. Not the class
 
####Methods - 
 Functions that can be used by/on objects of a specific class.
 
#### Class
 A class is an essential part of OOP.
 Classes are the cookie cutters for objects/instances
 
<u> A class is a collection of methods, which is a cookie cutter for making objects </u>

#### Abstractions
Hiding comlexity from the user and exposing only useful necessary stuff 
to get something done

    eg turning on a microwave
    - We know about pressing the start button
    
    - We don't need to know about the particle vibrations and the
    resonance 
    - We just know our food will be warmed
    
#### Inheritance
The ability to inherit behaviours and characteristics from a parent class
